    "## Discussion\n",

    "### Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis and logistic regression modeling conducted in this study provided important insights into the prediction of stroke events. Upon cleaning the dataset and ensuring that all variables were in a tidy format, we found that age, hypertension, and average glucose levels are statistically significant predictors of stroke, which supports existing literature on stroke risk factors. The importance of age as a risk factor was particularly pronounced in our analysis, which is consistent with the understanding that stroke risk increases with age.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of age and average glucose levels in predicting stroke highlights the importance of monitoring these factors in public health interventions. This could lead to more effective stroke prevention strategies targeted towards older populations and those with higher glucose levels. The finding that hypertension was not a significant predictor in this particular model could suggest that the effect of hypertension on stroke might be mediated through other factors not included in the model or that its role as a risk factor may vary across different populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations Versus Results\n",
    "\n",
    "While we expected BMI to be a significant predictor based on previous studies, it did not show statistical significance in our model. This could be due to the complexity of the relationship between BMI and stroke risk, which may not be captured by linear terms in logistic regression. Additionally, work type categories showed no significant association with stroke events, contrary to the hypothesis that occupational factors might contribute to stroke risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements to the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches could improve the model's predictive power:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incorporation of Interaction Terms**: Considering interactions between variables like age and hypertension or glucose levels could provide a more nuanced understanding of stroke risk factors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exploring Non-Linear Relationships**: Using polynomial or spline functions to model the relationship between continuous predictors like BMI and stroke may capture more complex associations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Non-Linear Models**: Given the limitations of logistic regression in capturing non-linear relationships, machine learning techniques like random forests or neural networks could be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling of Unknown Categories**: The 'Unknown' category in smoking status contributed to a significant amount of data. Techniques like multiple imputation could be used to handle these missing values better.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Expanded Variable Selection**: Including additional variables, such as socioeconomic status or access to healthcare, could reveal other significant predictors of stroke.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Research Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "This study opens several avenues for future research:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Longitudinal Analysis**: A longitudinal approach could be beneficial in capturing the temporal dynamics of stroke risk factors, allowing for the observation of changes over time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **More Complex Models**: Advanced predictive modeling techniques such as machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting machines) could be utilized to capture non-linear relationships and interactions more effectively.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **External Validation**: Applying the model to an independent dataset would help validate the findings and assess the model's generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the results of this study contribute to the body of knowledge on stroke risk prediction. Our findings reinforce the importance of age and average glucose levels as predictors and suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the role of hypertension and other potential risk factors in stroke occurrence. Despite the limitations encountered, the study provides a foundation for future investigations that could lead to more accurate and comprehensive stroke prediction models.\n"
